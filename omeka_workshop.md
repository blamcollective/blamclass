# bLAMclass: Omeka Workshop Notes

## Welcome to our first bLAMclass! Today we will learn: 

* How Omeka was developed and how it's used
* How the [Preserve the Baltimore Uprising] (http://baltimoreuprising2015.org/) archive project is using Omeka (including challenges, successes, and working with an outside developer)
* How other archives use this tool
* And finally, we'll catalog digital items and look at exhibits as a group

The class will be split into two sections: 

1. Presentation - [follow along if you'd like] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qDkkthWQhLW8hBl1GuWOUM0pH2qgwSJgC4y-dq1zjX0/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Hands-on demonstration of how [Omeka] (http://omeka.net) works
