# blamclass
bLAMclass is a free, tech-based workshop series to be offered to the public in the spring of 2016. 

bLAMcollective is interested in offering free technology-related workshops and skill shares geared toward students, cultural heritage professionals, archivists, librarians, journalists, educators, and anyone else who feels their work or free time could benefit from being introduced to new digital tools and techniques. A web survey was distributed on October 5, 2015 (and remains open) to develop a better understanding of the types of workshops and skillshares the community is interested in. Below we will post the results.
