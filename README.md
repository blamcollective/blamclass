# blamclass
bLAMclass is a free, tech-based workshop series to be offered to the public in the spring of 2016. 

bLAMcollective is interested in offering free technology-related workshops and skill shares geared toward students, cultural heritage professionals, archivists, librarians, journalists, educators, and anyone else who feels their work or free time could benefit from being introduced to new digital tools and techniques. A web survey was distributed on October 5, 2015 (and remains open) to develop a better understanding of the types of workshops and skillshares the community is interested in. Below are the results.

- **19** people filled out the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P51gbwDO1R47OTZSTy5TMRKukFYcEZKnk-QkQrP82ps/viewform) as of November 9, 2015.

##### Workshops
- 12 people would attend a workshop on **Omeka: Open Source/Free Content Management System**.
- 12 want a workshop on **AV Collections: Born-Digital and Analog**.
- 11 want a workshop on **Adobe Photoshop & Bridge for Post-Digitization**. 
Note: With Eli Pousson's suggestion, this will probably be expanded to line command for post-digitization to avoid software purchases that may be prohibitive.
